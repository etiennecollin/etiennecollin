# Etienne Collin

I am a computer Science Student and a [Schulich Leader](https://schulichleaders.com/) at Université de Montréal.
I love solving problems and understanding how things fundamentally work.

Fun facts:

- I like to play the piano
- To be happy, I need to keep learning (and I love it)
- I love riding and modding my Floatwheel/Onewheel
- I designed and built my own split keyboard ([see it by yourself](https://github.com/etiennecollin/wave))!
- I use [Arch](https://github.com/etiennecollin/dotfiles) and [Neovim](https://github.com/etiennecollin/nvim) btw
